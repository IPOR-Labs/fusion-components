You are JavaScript expert.

Read `spec-host-integration` and `implementation-plan` and `resources`.

<spec-host-integration>
/.cursor/rules/spec-host-integration.md
</spec-host-integration>

<implementation-plan>
/.cursor/rules/implementation-plan.md
</implementation-plan>

<resources>
https://vite.dev/guide/build
</resources>

Tips:
- `/src` folder contains basic Vite React app in normal mode (Library Mode).
- `/examples/rainbowkit` contains the host app that consumes the widget - this is the reference how I like to use the app however you can edit it as well.

Implement `step-name` from `implementation-plan`.

<step-name>
2. Add widget entry and global initializer
</step-name>

Once you are done mark that step as done in `implementation-plan` with âœ… emoji
